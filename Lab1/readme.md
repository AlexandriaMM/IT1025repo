## Executive Summary
The purpose of this lab is to provide the student with an introduction to Information Systems as well as to introduce a brief history of computing from the mainframe era to modern computing platforms such as cloud computing.

## Infomation System Components
What are Information Systems?

Information Systems are a collection of interrelated components that aid in collecting information, or data, for the purpose of processing, storing, and assisting in analysis and visualization for an organization.

The five components of Information Systems are:

*	Hardware: Physical component of a system such as input devices (keyboard, mouse, stylus), output devices (monitor, printer), and communication devices (modem, switch, bridge).

*	Software: Intangible component comprised of instructions such as an operating system or application.

*	Data: Collection of facts or information to be processed.

*	People: The users of a system from end-users to developers to the CIO (Chief Information Officer).

*   Processes: A series of steps to achieve a goal.  Modern organizations seek to automate and integrate processes to enhance productivity as well as gain advantage over competitors.

## GitHub
What is GitHub? 

GitHub is an online provider of source and version control for software development and other projects.  It is essentially a front-end to “git” utilizing additional features.  Furthermore, it is a client-server system published in the cloud.
<br><br>
### Client - Server Architecture
A client-server architecture is a system using primarily networking components and protocols to allow many “clients” to access a “server” that is responsible for central processing.  An early example of this technology includes electronic mail.
<br><br>
### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing is a paradigm of computing which provides mobile users with access to data or applications without the need for “local” storage of those applications.  Google Docs is an example of cloud computing where users have access to a full suite of office applications with an internet connection and a web browser.
<br><br>
## Conclusion
Reading the text and completing the lab for this unit, I have learned about the five components of Information Systems, as well as what is meant by client-server systems and cloud computing.  Secondly, I have gained a fundamental knowledge of git and GitHub as a hosted platform of source and version control.
