## Executive Summary
The purpose of Lab 6 is to teach students the foundational concepts of the World Wide Web including IP addresses, security protocols, layering, and Web standards.
<br><br>

## 1. IP and ICANN
a.) What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? <br>
    IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Data packets are sent to IP addresses to ensure packets are recieved at desired place. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots (ex: 192.0.2.53) while IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers using hexadecimal to fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots (ex: 2001:0db8::::53). The major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the available address space- IPv4 is a small limited pool of addresses compared to IPv6 which has 340 undecillion addresses.

c.) What is ICANN and how does the organization contribute to the global internet? <br>
    ICANN stands for "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers" and allocates IP address blocks to the five regional internet registries around the world

<br><br>

## 2. TCP/IP Protocol
a.) What is the responsibility of TCP/IP? <br>
    TCP/IP's responsibility is to ensure that each computer or device in a network has a unique IP address.
    
b.) explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP <br>
    The "Client" in a TCP/IP connection is a computer or device that sends a request while the "Server" is the computer listening for the request. The Client must know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also must know the port number that wants to send and receive data. Once the connection through TCP/IP port has been established between client and server, data can be sent in either direction. The connection remains open until client or server terminates the connection.

<br><br>

## 3. Layers
a.) Why are layers important to changing technology? <br>
    It is important to have layers so that tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers.
<br><br>

## 4. Application Layer
b.) What types of applications run on the "application" layer? <br>
    SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SNMP

<br><br>

## 5. HTTP and Client-Server Model
a.) Explain what HTTP is and how does it support the client-server model? <br>
    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages so a client sends a web address through a web browser and uses HTTP to retrieve the web page.

b.) Explain the protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data? <br>
    HTTPS or Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol Encrypts the data (using encryption algorithms) that is being retrieved by HTTP. HTTP protects data by using the SSL protocol. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) uses public key encryption to secure data meaning that an SSL certificate is used to authenticate the identity of a website (checks if website is trustworthy. The other protocol used called TLS (Transport Layer Security) and is the successor to SSL. Like SSL, TLS authenticates the server, client, and encrypts the data. 

<br><br>

## 6. Securing your Web Browser
a.) Why should you secure your web browser? <br>
    It's important to secure my web browser because there are increasing threats from software attacks that take advantage of vulnerable web browsers. Often the default settings on web browsers often are not the most secure settings.

b.) Explain one of the risks described in this article: <br>
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a vulnerability in web applications that allows a hacker to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users 
    
<br><br>
## 7. World Wide Web Consortium
a.) Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C? <br>
    Tim Berners-Lee is the leader of W3C and is also the inventor of the world web. W3C was created to the lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.

b.) Pick a standard of your choice and explain why it is important: <br>
    HTML & CSS are important as they are the core technologies for build Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page using markup while CSS describes the page layout or presentation for a variety of devices.

## Conclusion
The articles and videos attached helped me to learn about fundamental networking concepts I did not fully understand including the process of a client-server interaction using TCP/IP. Though I've been familiarized with certain standards I did not know about the companies that actually set the standards such as ICANN and W3C.
