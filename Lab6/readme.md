## 1. IP and ICANN
a.) What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
    IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Data packets are sent to IP addresses to ensure packets are recieved at desired place. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots (ex: 192.0.2.53) while IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers using hexadecimal to fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots (ex: 2001:0db8::::53). The major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the available address space- IPv4 is a small limited pool of addresses compared to IPv6 which has 340 undecillion addresses.

## 2. TCP/IP Protocol
a.) What is the responsibility of TCP/IP?
    TCP/IP's responsibility is to ensure that each computer or device in a network has a unique IP address.
    
b.) explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP
    The "Client" in a TCP/IP connection is a computer or device that sends a request while the "Server" is the computer listening for the request. The Client must know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also must know the port number that wants to send and receive data. Once the connection through TCP/IP port has been established between client and server, data can be sent in either direction.
