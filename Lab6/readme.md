<br><br>

## 1. IP and ICANN
a.) What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6? <br>
    IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Data packets are sent to IP addresses to ensure packets are recieved at desired place. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots (ex: 192.0.2.53) while IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers using hexadecimal to fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots (ex: 2001:0db8::::53). The major difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the available address space- IPv4 is a small limited pool of addresses compared to IPv6 which has 340 undecillion addresses.

c.) What is ICANN and how does the organization contribute to the global internet? <br>
    ICANN stands for "The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers" and allocates IP address blocks to the five regional internet registries around the world

<br><br>

## 2. TCP/IP Protocol
a.) What is the responsibility of TCP/IP? <br>
    TCP/IP's responsibility is to ensure that each computer or device in a network has a unique IP address.
    
b.) explain how the client-server model applies to TCP/IP <br>
    The "Client" in a TCP/IP connection is a computer or device that sends a request while the "Server" is the computer listening for the request. The Client must know the IP Address of whatever Server it wants to connect to and it also must know the port number that wants to send and receive data. Once the connection through TCP/IP port has been established between client and server, data can be sent in either direction. The connection remains open until client or server terminates the connection.

## 3. Layers
a.) Why are layers important to changing technology? <br>
    It is important to have layers so that tasks can be changed without affecting the other layers.
<br><br>

## 4. Application Layer
b.) What types of applications run on the "application" layer? <br>
    SMTP, FTP, HTTP, POP3, IMAP4, SNMP

<br><br>

## 5. HTTP and Client-Server Model
a.) Explain what HTTP is and how does it support the client-server model? <br>
    HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is the protocol that is used for viewing web pages so a client sends a web address through a web browser and uses HTTP to retrieve the web page.

b.) Explain the protocols that secure HTTP uses to protect data? <br>
    HTTPS or Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol Encrypts the data (using encryption algorithms) that is being retrieved by HTTP

## 6. Securing your Web Browser
a.) Why should you secure your web browser? <br>

b.) Explain one of the risks described in this article: <br>

## 7. World Wide Web Consortium
a.) Who was Tim Berners-Lee and why did he create the W3C? <br>
