## 1. IP and ICANN
a.) What is an IP address and what is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?
    IP addresses are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. Data packets are sent to IP addresses to ensure packets are recieved at desired place. IPv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by dots (ex: 192.0.2.53) while IPv6 addresses are considerably longer strings of numbers using hexadecimal to fit more information into fewer digits. Colons separate the segments of IPv6 addresses instead of dots (ex: 2001:0db8::::53). The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 seems to be the available address space- IPv4 is a small limited pool of addresses compared to IPv6 which has 340 undecillion addresses.
