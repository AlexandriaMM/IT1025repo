<h3> Executive Summary </h3> <br>
The purpose of my final project part 2, research paper (see attached PDF), is to inform the reader on the four pillars of object-oriented programming

<h3> Conclusion </h3> <br>
My overall experience was positive. My career goal is to return to my career in software development feeling more confident in object oriented principals. I have been passionate about programming for many years now and I'm always looking for ways I can improve my knowledge and implementation of programming concepts. My next step is to continue my education with tri-c and transfer back to Baldwin Wallace to complete my computer science degree.
